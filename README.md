# Project Tasks

Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app
    - Json data hosted on treehouse is parsed into the site and used to display a visual representation of accomplishments made on Treehouse

Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app (such as with fetch() or with AJAX)
    - Ajax call is made to obtain users profile data 

Create and use a function that accepts two or more values, calculates or determines a new value based on those inputs, and returns a value
    - One example is the function passing in skill and point values to create a representation of points earned for indivual skills compared to total points

Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
    - AM & PM Groups of Badges

Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
    - Similar to githubs contribution graph badges are displayed with a visual indication of the time of day they were complete
